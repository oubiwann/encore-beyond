Introduction
============

This is a project the demonstrates what a RESTful service in `LFE`_ looks like
when run on top of the `YAWS`_ (`Erlang`_) web server. This may be forked and
used as the starter codebase for your own project.


Dependencies
------------

This project assumes that you have `rebar`_ installed somwhere in your
``$PATH``.

If you are running Ubuntu, you will need to install the following:

.. code:: bash

    $ sudo apt-get install erlang libpam0g-dev

The latter is needed to compile YAWS.

This project depends upon the following, which is automatically installed by
rebar to the ``deps`` directory of this project when you run ``make deps``
(also done implicitely by ``make compile``):

* `LFE`_ (Lisp Flavored Erlang; needed only to compile)
* `lfeunit`_ (needed only to run the unit tests)
* `YAWS`_ (The granddaddy of Erlang web servers)


Installation
============

Just clone this puppy and jump in:

.. code:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/lfe/yaws-rest-starter.git
    $ cd yaws-rest-starter
    $ make compile

This will install all the dependencies and compile everything you need.

Troubleshooting
---------------

If your compile process fails, you may need to run ``make get-deps`` explicitly
and then re-run ``make compile``.


The Demo Server
===============


Starting and Stopping
---------------------

To start the YAWS server + demo REST service in development mode, with any
printing (e.g., ``(: io format ...)``) sent to sdout, just do this:

.. code:: bash

    $ make dev

To run the daemon, do:

.. code:: bash

    $ make run

To stop the server once in daemon mode, do:

.. code:: bash

    $ make stop


Checking the HTTP Verbs
-----------------------

You can make calls to and example the responses from the demo REST server
with curl.

Here's a ``GET``:

.. code:: bash

    $ curl -D- -X GET http://localhost:8000/
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Server: Yaws 1.98
    Date: Fri, 07 Feb 2014 04:57:58 GMT
    Content-Length: 34
    Content-Type: application/json

    {"data": "Here, hazsomeGETdataz!"}

And a ``POST``:

.. code:: bash

    $ curl -D- -X POST http://localhost:8000/
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Server: Yaws 1.98
    Date: Fri, 07 Feb 2014 04:58:38 GMT
    Content-Length: 34
    Content-Type: application/json

    {"data": "YOU madesomePOSTdataz!"}

One more: a Here's a ``GET``:

.. code:: bash

    $ curl -D- -X OPTIONS http://localhost:8000/
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Server: Yaws 1.98
    Date: Fri, 07 Feb 2014 04:59:44 GMT
    Content-Length: 38
    Content-Type: application/json

    {"data": "Here, hazsomeOPTIONSdataz!"}


Benchmarks
==========

Benchmarks are a lie. Okay, now that we've gotten that out of the way, on
with the lies!

Running ``httperf`` and ``ab`` against the demo REST service on a 2012 MacBook
Pro laptop with tons of other crap running on it gives **reqs/s** in the
**14,000** to **18,000** range.

Here's an example ``ab`` command that was used:

.. code:: bash

    $ ab -k -c 100 -n 20000 http://localhost:8000/

And one for ``httperf``:

.. code:: bash

    $ httperf --hog \
      --server localhost --port 8000 --uri / \
      --timeout 5 --rate 100 \
      --num-calls 10000 --num-conns 10


Development
===========

For a simple REST service, you might only need to replace the code for each
HTTP verb in ``src/yaws-rest-starter.lfe``. For more involved work, you could
split each of those out in to separate functions, e.g.:

.. code:: lisp

    (defun handle
      (('GET arg)
       (handle-get arg))
      (('POST arg)
       (handle-post arg))
       ...
       )

    (defun handle-get
      "Lots of complicated logic, possibly with intricate pattern matching
      of the arg parameter."
      (( ...
       )))

One could take this a step further for even more complicated projects with
larger codebases, and move the dispatched functions into their own modules.
For instance, in ``./src/your-project.lfe``:

.. code:: lisp

    (defun handle
      (('GET arg)
       (: your-project-gets handle arg))
       ...
       )

And then have a ``src/your-project-gets.lfe`` file for this code that defines
``handle``:

.. code:: lisp

    (defun handle
      "Lots of complicated logic, possibly with intricate pattern matching
      of the arg parameter, with each pattern dispatching to other code in
      the module."
      (( ...
       )))
